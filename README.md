# Food Truck Project

## Description
This program prompts the user to enter data for up to 5 food truck objects. Once data is entered, the object is stored in an array containing no more than 5 objects. 

Once data entry is completed, the user is then shown a menu where they can request several pieces of information on the objects contained within the array.  The user will stay in a loop of the menu until they elect to quit, at which point the program is terminated.
## Lessons Learned
This was definitely the most exposure I've ever had to objects & OOP. While I'm still brand new and somewhat uncomfortable with objects, this exercise was excellent exposure. I no longer feel like a hatchling, perhaps I've grown into a nestling (hopefully whoever is reading this also has a bird-obsessed grandfather).
